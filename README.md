# Job Portal - Full-Stack Application

This project is a simple **Job Portal** platform where an **admin** can manage job postings, track candidates who apply for those jobs, and create job-specific assessments. The platform helps streamline the hiring process by allowing admins to:

- Post jobs
- Review candidate details
- Assign tailored assessments for each job opening

The application consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React app for the user interface (UI)
- **Backend**: An Express server to handle API requests and data management

## Project Structure
